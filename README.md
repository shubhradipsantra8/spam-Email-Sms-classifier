# spam-Email-Sms-classifier
A machine-learning project that classifies emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning techniques. This project demonstrates end-to-end text classification including preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and predictions on custom input.

🚀 Features

Text preprocessing (cleaning, lowercasing, punctuation removal)

Tokenization and stopword removal

Feature extraction using:

CountVectorizer (Bag-of-Words)

TF-IDF Vectorizer

Multiple ML models (depending on implementation), such as:

Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Random Forest

Model evaluation metrics:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Predict spam for new/unseen email text
